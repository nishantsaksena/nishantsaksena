🧑‍💻 About Me

I’m an Infrastructure & Reliability Engineer focused on building safe, scalable compute systems that power responsible AI.
My work spans large-scale GPU deployments, multi-datacenter operations, diagnostics automation, cluster recovery, and fault-remediation workflows that ensure high availability for AI training and inference environments.

🚀 Key Accomplishments

✔ Led reliability & recovery for 200k+ NVIDIA GPUs
→ Built automation-first workflows, accelerated swap pipelines, and reduced MTTR by days.
→ Prevented large-scale hardware churn and restored compute for critical AI workloads.

✔ Improved multi-datacenter operational efficiency by 50%+
→ Developed scalable bulk-action systems and fault-signature detection pipelines.
→ Achieved 80%+ recovery success and cleared major cross-site backlog queues.

✔ Delivered on-site leadership across global datacenters
→ Resolved systemic blockers, performed readiness & acceptance testing, and upskilled technician teams.
→ Raised deployment velocity, reliability, and customer confidence.
